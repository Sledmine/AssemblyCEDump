# AssemblyCEDump
Repository of stuff that I found about Halo Custom Edition reverse engineering

ASM files on this repository are not indeed just asm stuff, they are dumps from OllyDbg that I used
to gather when playing around with CE debugging.

TXT files are mainly addresses and patches I found that you can apply to CE by modifying a few
instructions here and there.
